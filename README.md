# Bike-Share Analysis

## About

In 2016, Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company, launched a successful bike-share program in Chicago. Cyclistic's flexible pricing plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while those with annual memberships are known as Cyclistic members.

## Objective

The primary objective of this Excel project is to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. This analysis will help design targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains trip data from June 2023, provided directly by [Cyclistic](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been cleaned and prepared in Excel to ensure data quality and consistency.
