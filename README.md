# About 
In 2016, Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company, launched a successful bike-share program in Chicago. Cyclistic's flexible pricing plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while those with annual memberships are known as Cyclistic members.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. This analysis will help design targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

# Dataset
The data utilized in this project is hosted on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). For this analysis, I am using trip data of the month June 2023. This dataset, provided directly by Cyclistic, has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under the [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data has been anonymized to ensure privacy, excluding any personally identifiable information. While this limits the ability to analyze specific personal attributes, such as individual rider histories or residential areas, there is ample data available to identify overall usage patterns and behaviors.
