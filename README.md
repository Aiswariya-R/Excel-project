# Excel-project

The data utilized in this project is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). For this analysis, I am using trip data of the month June 2023. This dataset, provided directly by Cyclistic, has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under the license. The data has been anonymized to ensure privacy, excluding any personally identifiable information. While this limits the ability to analyze specific personal attributes, such as individual rider histories or residential areas, there is ample data available to identify overall usage patterns and behaviors.
